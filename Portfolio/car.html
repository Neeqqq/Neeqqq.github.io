			<p>A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads,</p>
			<p>seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars came into global use during the 20th century,</p>
			<p>and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Carl Benz</p>
			<p>patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.  Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible </p>
			<p>to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US,</p>
			<p>where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts. In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not </p>
			<p>increase until after World War II.... <a class="more"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car">(wikipedia)</a></p>
